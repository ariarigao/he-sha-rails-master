## Business Design
You fancy having a drink at home. Raiding the cupboards, you find a random selection of bottles. You think to yourself, what can I make?
An interactive web application that allows you to search through cocktail recipes according to what alcohol and ingredients you have at home.

## General Instruction
 Designed and implemented a web program that helps users search for cocktails based on available ingredients and view recommended cocktails using Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Postman, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
  Incorporated Elastic Search to enable full-text search for user inputs. Used REST API’s to perform HTTP requests.	 	
Applied user-based collaborative filtering to predict cocktails that a user might like based on a similar user’s past likes.
 Used PostgreSQL to store scraped recipe data, user’s activity, and favorite cocktails, and deployed backend server to Heroku. 	

## Website Demo
Deployed the project on Heroku. hesha.herokuapp.com
No longer in use and updated as of Sep.2021.
